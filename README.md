Theme to fit with KDE/Plasma Breeze look.

Still very much work in progress, but it works. If you are good with this kind of things, feel free to fork the project.

TODO:
1. color of toolbar whould be darker
2. icons
3. some-on-dark panels, es. pop-up windows of delayed notification
4. make border appear around toolbar buttons on mouse hover (is this possible?)
